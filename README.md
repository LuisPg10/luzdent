# Luz Dent Project

## Install dependencies ⚙️

Keep in mind using the package manager of your preference and not combining them.
If you are going to use a different one, remove the corresponding lock file (package-lock.json, bun.lock, yarn.lock, etc).

```sh
bun install
```

## Add environment variables

For example `VITE_PHONE_NUMBER=<YOUR PHONE NUMBER>`

## Execute the project 🚀

Similarly, execute the project in the execution environment of your preference or with the preferred package manager.

```sh
bun run dev
```
